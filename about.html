<p>The Colchester Eagles Dodgeball Club was formed in 2014 by Paul Jones, a former player for the Raging Bulls. 
The original vision of the club had the sole aim of getting a group of friends together to throw a few balls and have a few laughs.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, months and years more people showed an interest in sport, club memberships grew and there was a greater desire than ever before to play competitively. The Colchester Eagles competed in their first season with the UKDBA in 2015/2016 and still enter competitions throughout the season around the UK. 
Despite the competitive play, the Eagles never lose sight of the core foundations the club was built on and will always maintain the fun, loving and relaxed spirit of the club.</p>
<br>
<p>In case you needed more persuading here are a few words from the main man himself, Paul Jones:</p>

<strong>Why did you decide to start this club? </strong>

<p>After moving from the Wirral to the South, I always missed the sport and there was quite simply no local club. I broached the idea to my workmates to just get together and play some games for a laugh, it seems word spread and soon after we formed the Colchester Eagles Dodgeball Club. </p>

<strong>Why should people join the club? </strong>
<p>No matter what walk of life you are from there will always be a place for you at the club. We are a community club, our members have full-time jobs and families but make time for the sport they enjoy and love. </p>
<strong>How would you best describe the club? </strong>
<p>Off the fudging chain AND never dull a moment </p> 
<strong>Favourite part of the sport?</strong>
<p>Despite the competitive nature and ill temper on occasions, there will always be a classic comedy moment in a dodgeball match– this could be awesome catch or awkwardly positioned shot – you can never predict what happens in the game. </p>
<strong>Do you have a signature move? </strong>
<p>Inability to dodge and get knocked out whilst my girlfriend was in Antarctica</p>
<strong>Sales pitch and final word...</strong> 
<p> If you want to learn a new game, have some fun, make a group of friends, and travel up and down the country to play the sport, then we are the club for you. No politics, no bad feeling just dodgeball. </p>
<strong><center>Eagles are you ready…3…2…1…kakaaa</center></strong>
